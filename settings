## ZSH Settings

# Vim mode
bindkey -v 

# This binds Up and Down (or j/k in vim cmd mode)
# to a substring history search, backwards and forwards, 
# based upon what has already been entered at the prompt.

# Run cat -v in your favorite terminal emulator to observe key codes.      
# (NOTE: In some cases, cat -v shows the wrong key codes. 
# If the key codes shown by cat -v don't work for you, 
# press <C-v><UP> and <C-v><DOWN> at your ZSH command line prompt for correct key codes.)
# For example, if you observed ^[[A for UP and ^[[B for DOWN, then
bindkey '^[[A' history-substring-search-up
bindkey '^[[B' history-substring-search-down

# However, if the observed values don't work, you can try using terminfo:
bindkey "$terminfo[kcuu1]" history-substring-search-up
bindkey "$terminfo[kcud1]" history-substring-search-down

bindkey -M vicmd 'k' history-substring-search-up
bindkey -M vicmd 'j' history-substring-search-down
